I'm from France 🇫🇷 and I started development at a young age.

I'm passionate about building new things and I'm a self-taught programmer.

I have a bachelor's degree in foreign languages. I speak 🇫🇷 🇺🇸 🇮🇹 🇨🇳.

I founded [Fit Learn](www.fit-learn.com) in 2022 to help students succeed.

I always loved Apple products and I've never enjoyed as much programming as I do when making Apple apps 😁.
