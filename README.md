I'm from France 🇫🇷 and I started development at a young age.
I'm passionate about building new things and I'm a self-taught programmer.
I have a bachelor's degree in foreign languages. I speak 🇫🇷 🇺🇸 🇮🇹 🇨🇳.
I founded [Fit Learn](www.fit-learn.com) in 2022 to help students succeed.
I always loved Apple products and I've never enjoyed as much programming as I do when making Apple apps 😁.
